# **What is missing from the documentation and the code**

As you can see, this documentation is far from perfect and lacks a lot of info.

I will try to spend as many time I can to update the documentation with explications and examples. For now, I have created a basic documentation with the basic functions explained.

Also, the code needs to be well commented and cleaned a bit, I'm spanish but usually try to add comments and class names in english, but as it was done in a rush it has a ver strange mix of spanish and english language, lol, I promise I will add good comments on the code and rename all the names to english.

And finally, some functionality to be fully HTTP/1.1 compliant is missing, like support for persistent connections and trails with chunk encoding.

If you want to help the GusNet project, please leave me a message in the discussion section and if you **REALLY** are going to help, gladly will give you access to the source code control.
