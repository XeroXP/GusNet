# **GusHttpServer**

Definifion: _+public abstract class GusHttpServer+_

The GusHttpServer plus the GusHttpProcessor constitute the core of the package. 

The GusHttpServer accepts incomming connections and creates new GusHttpProcessors for each one. Also includes an abstract function named HandleRequest which is called by each [GusHttpProcessor](GusHttpProcessor.md) created. In this way you can create your own server just inheriting the GusHttpServer and handling the request in the HandleRequest function.

The corresponding [GusHttpProcessor](GusHttpProcessor.md) is passed to each call to the HandleRequest, so the concrete request is identifyed.

The resulting HTTP server of the combination of GusHttpServer and GusHttpProcessor creates an HTTP server conformant to the HTTP/1.1 specification with the lack of keep alive support.
